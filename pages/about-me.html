        <p class="about-journey">
            As a third-year university student, I've embarked on a fascinating journey through the world of technology and education.
            With a year's experience at Pre Uni New College and a similar tenure at CS Education, I've honed my skills in nurturing young minds. 
            Specializing in preparing primary school students for Selective exams, my role has been pivotal in shaping the future of young learners. 
            This experience has not only enriched my understanding of educational pedagogy but also reaffirmed my commitment to making learning accessible 
            and engaging.
        </p>

        <p class="about-passion">
            Programming is not just a skill for me; it's a passion that drives me to explore, create, and innovate. My enthusiasm for tackling 
            LeetCode problems regularly has sharpened my problem-solving skills, making each challenge a stepping stone towards mastery. 
            Game development and web development are realms where I unleash my creativity, blending logic with imagination to craft immersive experiences.
        </p>

        <p class="about-skills">
            My toolkit is as diverse as it is deep, with proficiency in Unity, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, Python, TypeScript, and Shell scripting. 
            This extensive skill set enables me to navigate the multifaceted landscape of technology with ease. What sets me apart is not just my ability to 
            learn quickly but also my resilience in the face of challenges. I approach each obstacle with a focused, driven mindset, ensuring that no problem 
            remains unsolved for long.
        </p>

        <p class="about--me">
            At my core, I am outgoing and driven, qualities that propel me forward in both my personal and professional endeavors. 
            My journey is one of continuous learning and growth, where each project and every line of code is a step towards realizing my vision of 
            innovating for impact.
