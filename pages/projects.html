            Over the last few years I have worked on many projects. I have had a great interest in
            programming and being inspired by the many youtube videos I saw of creators working on
            their passion projects, I decided to work on some of my own.

            <p class='project' id="Project-B" onclick="loadProject(1, this)">Solar System <p class="hidden project-info" id="Project-B-info">
From a young age, I've been captivated by the vast expanse of space, marveling at its grand scale and the intricate physics governing celestial interactions. Motivated by Sebastian Lague's video, I embarked on crafting my own simulation of gravitational forces. Employing Newton's Gravitational Equation, I fashioned a simulation that vividly illustrates the cosmic ballet performed by celestial bodies.<br> <a href="https://github.com/prith82003/Solar-System/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>•Code•</a></p> </p>
            <p class='project' id="Project-C" onclick="loadProject(2, this)">2048 <p class="hidden project-info" id="Project-C-info">Playing the game sparked my curiosity about its mechanics, motivating me to develop my own version. This led me to embark on my first comprehensive project, culminating in the completion of a 2048 game. I crafted the start, pause, and game over screens, resulting in a fully operational game.<br> <a href="https://github.com/prith82003/2048/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>•Code•</a></p> </p>
            <p class='project' id="Project-D" onclick="loadProject(3, this)">Procedural Planet <p class="hidden project-info" id="Project-D-info">My fascination for space resulted in another project, inspired by Sebastian Lague's video on procedural planets, I created my own implementation which created procedural celestial bodies and shaded them procedurally. Through this project I learnt much about writing HLSL and code for the GPU and how interfacing between the CPU and GPU works.<br> <a href="https://github.com/prith82003/ProceduralPlanetV2/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>•Code•</a></p> </p>
            <p class='project' id="Project-E" onclick="loadProject(4, this)">Grass Wind Simulation <p class="hidden project-info" id="Project-E-info">I am deeply fascinated by the way code can mirror nature, a concept that fills me with awe. Driven by this inspiration, I developed a scene depicting grass swaying in the wind. This project enriched my understanding of the GPU, introduced me to the concept of GPU instancing and its mechanics, and taught me how to manipulate the mesh using post-processing code.<br> <a href="https://github.com/prith82003/Grass-Field/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>•Code•</a></p> </p>
            <p class='project' id="Project-F" onclick="loadProject(5, this)">Falling Sand Simulation <p class="hidden project-info" id="Project-F-info">Exploring The Powder Toy game piqued my curiosity about its inner workings, prompting me to develop my own iteration. I delved into the mechanics of falling sand games and focused on crafting my simulation. By employing Unity and Object-Oriented design principles, I successfully completed the project.<br> <a href="https://github.com/prith82003/Grass-Field/" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>•Code•</a></p> </p>
